# Municipal Solid Waste Prediction

This project explores the use of state-of-the-art machine learning and deep learning models for predicting municipal solid waste (MSW) generation in various geographical regions.

## About

This repository contains a collection of experiments that attempt to predict municipal solid waste generation for five areas around the world. We implement and evaluate nine different machine learning and deep learning models using both single-model and multi-model ensemble approaches.

## Models Implemented

- ARIMA
- LightGBM
- Prophet
- Linear Regression
- Random Forest
- N-BEATS
- LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)
- TCN (Temporal Convolutional Network)
- Transformer

## Datasets

We use datasets from five areas:
- Boralesgamuwa, Sri Lanka
- Moratuwa, Sri Lanka
- Dehiwala, Sri Lanka
- Austin, USA (open-source)
- Ballarat, Australia (open-source)
